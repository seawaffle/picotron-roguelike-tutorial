# Introduction
This is a tutorial on how to make a basic roguelike in [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php). It follows the basic structure of the [TCOD tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/), but explaining how to do it in Picotron. I'm not going to say that this is necessarily the best way to do things, since I'm writing this partially as a way to get myself to actually do something in Picotron. If you see anything that you think could be improved, feel free to submit a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/seawaffle/picotron-roguelike-tutorial). Also, the p64 file for each part is available on Github as well, though they're not super-readable.

This tutorial is super indebted to the roguelike tutorials that came before it, specifically:
- [The TCOD tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)
- [Nick Klepinger's ROT.js tutorial](https://klepinger.dev/rotjs-tutorial)
- [The RLTK tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/)

Go read them! They're great, and unless you're super interested in Picotron, they're without a doubt some of the best ways to start writing a roguelike.
