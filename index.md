# Introduction
This is a tutorial on how to make a basic roguelike in [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php). It follows the basic structure of the [TCOD tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/), but explaining how to do it in Picotron.

- [Part 0: Setting up](./part-0/part-0.html)
- [Part 1: Drawing the player and moving it around](./part-1/part-1.html)
- [Part 2: Generic entities and the map](./part-2/part-2.html)
- [Part 3: Dungeon Generation](./part-3/part-3.html)


This tutorial is super indebted to the roguelike tutorials that came before it, specifically:
- [The TCOD tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)
- [Nick Klepinger's ROT.js tutorial](https://klepinger.dev/rotjs-tutorial)
- [The RLTK tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/)

Go read them! They're great, and unless you're super interested in Picotron, they're without a doubt some of the best ways to start writing a roguelike.
